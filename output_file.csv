"The Missing Piece: a review of what happens if you use VR for an extended time, especially for full-time work environments. Back in the 1990&#39;s I was at a seminar featuring Maxine Brown of UIC&#39;s ImmersaDesk. Wearing no headset, and seated at a non-VR table, she was unable to speak without her hands floating around her, memory-driven, as if plucking information within her VR space. Now ... I test at 99% Spatial Reasoning, and would adore using VR for everything ... but having seen her inability to disengage her body enough to retrieve thoughts and vocalize without that accompanying physical mimic ... made me realize I would never really want to go down such a virtual rabbit hole when I already enjoy an internal spatial vr-type-ability on my own. I felt sad for her artificial VR tick, but also felt free and at peace for myself over a technology I&#39;d (needlessly) yearned over for decades.,",[]

I&#39;m not in the Apple environment and I&#39;m not going to drop the kind of cash to pick one of these up but the design is truly impressive. Really well thought out and excellent execution. Does it work for people who are long or short sighted and would normally need glasses?<br><br>What would be really impressive would be a fully immersive map app that can overlay the real world and give you directions. If that app can also adjust light levels so you can basically see in the dark like a cat then it would break reality in the best way.<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to 20 years from now and we&#39;ll probably have something the size and weight of Google glass but all the functionality of the Vision Pro and integrates AI seamlessly.

"There&#39;s a lot to like and there&#39;s a lot to hate. The number one thing I like about it is that there&#39;s going to be a lot of creative professionals with really expensive software, multitasking with these things and providing feedback to software developers which is going to lead to some efficient leaps and bounds that we haven&#39;t been able to see in the more gaming centric headsets preceding Apple&#39;s contribution to the field.<br>The outward-facing OLED in my opinion is kind of wasteful but who am I to say what rich people should do with their money and I suppose there&#39;s some gotta be some kind of reasonable use outside of cosmetic use... ?<br>But yeah, it wastes money, and what is already a miniscule battery.<br>I hate the proprietary plug that&#39;s really stupid for consumers, the external battery pack leaving the headset completely front focused shows that they&#39;ve got a long way to go and they&#39;re rather tone deaf regarding actual long-term use of a VR headset. The lack of 3D virtualized environmental offerings beyond what is likely to be an excellent pass through and otherwise augmented reality experience is off-putting, but it&#39;s good to see that despite the closed ecosystem there are people out there making these things work and additionally I figure eventually it will be a priority to actually provide interesting software and services supporting their platform. I do think there&#39;s a certain element of anti-competitive practices that are keeping a lot of software from being supported on the Apple platform but I&#39;m not surprised by that as they&#39;re late to the game and capitalizing like they normally do.<br>in the end additionally the exorbitant cost of this thing isn&#39;t really something that should be surprising considering this is definitely an early adopter thing and as such while it has a lot of good features these are basically the stock standard features that everyone expects in virtual at this time but again with a price point that is 3 - 8 times more than it&#39;s nearest competitors depending on where you place this in the market. The trick to that is is it&#39;s not really in an external market and that&#39;s the strength that it brings to the external market oddly enough. The fact is the strongest thing about this headset is that it&#39;s going to bring people from within the apple microculture and introduce them to something they&#39;ve stayed mostly ignorant about and and it&#39;s going to bring a lot of enthusiasm and innovation into the future of entertainment and what is essentially the evolution of the cell phone and micro computer.<br>I only wish they had gone with a transparent setup with a an electronic array of localized dimmers or glass that can be made opaque in zones so the passthrough and display elements could work in tandem and allowing an overlay on things you can actually see through the displays rather than relying only on cameras and lidar for producing passthrough. That it&#39;s not a full XR experience is a bummer, but the more these megacorp entities invest in the tech, and the more they saddle the losses for the sake of the longevity of the innovations, the better it will be for us, so I&#39;m all for it, at least in the context of advancing the technology.<br>So, were not really even close to Being there with this headset, but at least it&#39;s opening more eyes to the reality of virtual reality, and how beneficial it can be for many.","[{'span': 'software', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'battery pack', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'software', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'services', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'software', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
