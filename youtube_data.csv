Propriety connections... hmmmm.. Apple up to it&#39;s old tricks again! They just can&#39;t keep the lid on their batshitcrazy.
the outside display is quite dim even for white skin
The most order this thing will get is from US DOD they will use this any day over BAE 500k helmet with way better visual quality
"It looks just like any of these Chinese AR glasses, but with somewhat better controls"
How practical is this thing?
Is life better with this thing or without this thing?
Who would need this?
"Once Samsung takes on this space it&#39;s going to be amazing especially if they integrate connectivity with all their other devices; smart TVs, smartphones and all..."
Nice  futuristic options in it but not 4K nice.
Definitely can see this being outdated already
there might not be killer apps. i know a bunch of killer websites tho.
Ok am buying the Meta quest
"thank you for this review.<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/EvkfY6uNC5OykQOewoCQAQ""></a>"
Isn&#39;t that AR and not VR?
🔥🔥🔥 appreciate this video
ecosystem is a downside when it comes to apple not a plus
The black orange site is the killer app.
How can i setup the external camera for more quality? ( 240p at now )

"No YouTube or Netflix app is almost a deal killer, almost"
"I think it’s not good , why because this app belong to for one person. If you have a big family you should have mane app 🤔"
Well Done!  It was a pleasure watching.  Thanks!
Really great review.  12/10. 🥂
I think this is a sad moment for humanity… the implications of this plus AI are infinite. great review though!
Bruh 3.5K for that no way!
The future is coming
so whats the use of this thing exactly?!
The implications of this are insane. Just think about how you can apply filters to people around you to make everyone look like super models. Or make everyone look like bowser. In real time. This is going to change the way we live. Possibly how we treat each other.
I can&#39;t buy still watching
Dunno on all this tech i hear Ipads go for 100-150 used its as large as a VR screen
"I really thought the tv stand was the most confused by mac people I&#39;d ever get, but no... once again, yall fuckin blow my mind."
"One important question, we may wonder!   How many hours of Vision Pro we can use,  until we used up our eyes.   <br>Simple down to, what wave of light, is going into user&#39;s eyes"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=2133"">35:33</a> That’s the most subtle FedEx ad I have ever seen"
"I just don&#39;t see the value for the cost justifying itself. I mean, this is a very, very, expensive piece of equipment. If people are happy with it, cool, but it seems like it&#39;s a niche thing and made for those with lots of disposable income and not the general public."
What&#39;s the point of all the regular apps? The ones without 3D functionality? The headset is just useless for them.
So good!
i like the look of the AVP
RIP my neck
I am super impressed with your video and with the tech. Both are best-in-class.
I want it just so I can have a pretend race car in my house.
"Just what we need, soulless corporation tracking our microexpressions and eye glances.  No wonder they&#39;re pushing this"
Imagine if google glass actually buckled down and kept production going
I feel that this video is a paid advertisment.
Will it blow my head off like my ex did?
"No Netflix, spotify or youtube. So the most important apps aren&#39;t available. Got it."
"The only killer app I can see here is the ability to impersonate someone you aren&#39;t. Here is the problem: when I talk to you, I want to talk to YOU. You can be the nicest person in the world, but if you pull a fake avatar on me even once, then you are automatically in my liars&#39; bin and you will never get out of there."
"NOT THE ONLY WAY TO TURN OFF , it shuts off like iphone hold LEFT TOP BUTTON AND RIGHT SHUTTER BUTTON. It will pop up on screen and you will see the normal slide shutoff sequence"
"For an old fart like me, what possible use could I have for this gadget?"
Three more years until 2027 crazyyyyyyyy
I can’t wait till I’m thirteen 😊😊😊😊😊😊
"Despite any cons in the list, this product is just incredible 👀"
"You said it calibrates to your eyes? Will it be able to do that through the lenses of my glasses? Is there enough room to accommodate a pair of glasses without touching the inside of the Vision Pro lens? Or would I need to switch to contact lenses? When I wear contacts, they are bifocal contacts. Will these work? I&#39;m far sighted with astigmatism."
Stupid thing to spend money on😂
Mane got paid so much for this video $cashman2k22 help me out
"Apple should add another camera to their phone to enable you to take stereoscopic photos and videos (3d photos and videos), then you could view them on the apple vison pro."
"Awesome review, this video saved me from wasting $4,000 on another useless Apple product :)"
Whats the use if I cant use youtube and Netflix
"Imagine rewatching it in 10 years- “lol, look how bulky and awkward it is!”"
review a perc 30 next
"I&#39;m just a 16 year old kid. But i know how to make high quality good looking websites. But I&#39;m in urgency need of money. And i have to earn some money. No kidding here.<br><br> Can anyone tell me how can i earn money by web development. Many freelancing platforms like freelancer upwork and others have age limits. But i can build good websites. <br><br>I came here as I know his videos are popular and I am also one of his subscribers, and thought someone would see my comment and help me.<br>Would really appreciate your help. Thanks in advance 🙏"
imagine a future everyone is like this wearing vision pro
"Nope it’s not for me, I don’t like being compromised from the real world. I don’t even wear ear buds or headsets. But that’s just me."
I love the Apple Vision Pro
I hope I could order a Apple Vision Pro before they ran out
I used my sons VR for about 40min. I was left with a headache and feeling cross eyed
Imagine playing osu! with that thing
Very cool 😎
Man you are the best
Im just happy; if you ever watched READY PLAYER ONE: yes we are headed there😊
"still, why would you buy this thing, what is it for?"
Hey dude always enjoy your stuff. Your reviews really help me with purchases…. but I need a Flossy Carter sign off. You think you could talk him into trying it out. Not to mention that would be one helluva collaboration ❤
I didn’t know thanasis had a yt channel
No matter what I am buying .. amazing technology 😮
How to turn a person into a zombie.
"The fact that this is your second most viewed video of all time in the history of your channel (25 million within a four week time period at the time of posting this comment) says a lot about the popularity of this product. You’ve made a lot of brilliant videos in the many years you’ve been on this platform, and you gained 25 million views on this insanely fast, and it says a lot. Absolute insanity. Obviously the amount of views gained in this case is not just down to the popularity of the product, but it’s also down to the popularity of you. You’ve always made high-quality, informative, well produced and well edited videos. I love that your main goal is to inform customers of everything they need to know before making purchases or even after making purchases. You were a good egg. Keep up the hard work and I say that not just yourself Mark but to your entire team. Thank you for all you do."
"1year later 500,000,000$ lawsuit due to Blindness cause by wearing Apple vision pro 20hours a day"
Woah
"2 Hours??? That&#39;s hilarious, my Xbox 360 controller lasts <b><i>WAY</i></b> longer than that! 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
A BTS video of this review would be sweet! 🙃
"I don&#39;t care about this thing at all. I&#39;ll never buy one, but I just watched this 36 minute video...That&#39;s how good you are at this!"
Watches in poverty
For the oil tycoon child with nothing to live for
Nah I wanna pass
What nonsense. The novelty will wear off really fast.
"If they have a batterypack anyway, why not build lighter glasses again and put the components in a box? <br>Who designed these?! Lmao"
Is that your sister in the thumbnail?
"Did they created gadget that will make youth more addicted to net , thus more control over a being? On contrary ,it can be useful for individuals who’s working on the net. Instead of sitting 8-10 h at the desk,this can be useful"
Just be sure if u use these not to wear them in big cities. You are warned now
apple is close to be Tony Stark Industry
people calling it odd to wear in conversation but its just the start to where it will be
We’re so close to the nervgear from Sao
how many pages of script does this video have ?
"This is weird, and as pointless as the google glasses"
25 million views this guy hella rich off apple. legendary
Wonderful overview. I just did the demo at the Apple Store and you really added a LOT to my understanding.
9 days old video and already your second most popular video ever. Crazy and well done Marques 👍
One of the best tech reviews ive ever seen. i wasn&#39;t bored a bit and half and hour passed like it was 10 to 12 minute. great video as always
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=2193"">36:33</a> Pros and cons"
"This is some pretty dystopian Black Mirror stuff, right here."
does it have night vision ?
Worst product Apple has put out. Might have a lot of applications within the work environment but otherwise it&#39;s a straight no.  Horrible device.
im down but gonna wait for Vision Pro 2
This device both scares me and excites me lol
It&#39;s secretly an Obito Cosplay.
ready player 1 prequel
"That look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1745"">29:05</a> had me howling with laughter haha"
It’s good innovation. But not for the average consumers yet
What about crosseyed people?
"Hi @marques, have you ever wondered that Andro-humanoid robot named Sophia handling apple vision pro, can you please make a video or provide information on that."
In terms of high quality materials you propably should watch Jerry&#39;s video
Want play but i&#39;m poor 😂
The attached external battery makes no sense when you could just buy a separate battery pack for 20 dollars and use as needed
I found a cool social app on vision pro called inSpaze
"So apple made their own cable again, just like the lightning jack. In the EU by law, electronic devices should come with USB-C cables to limit the E-Waste we produce. How did they get away with this bs again?"
"itd be cool if they made it so you could lock what ur looking at and then look elsewhere and still controll what u were lookin at. maybe like a double click with the other hand, or making a fist while lookin at it"
Lbs bro use or mention lbs for the rest of us peasants 😅 god now I have to go to Google to convert 😢
"That Facetime demo looked really cool!  But it&#39;s disturbing how the personas &quot;eat&quot; your ears.  The hair is kinda bad, but the missing ears throws it straight into uncanny valley for me."
One step closer to the oasis from ready player one lol😅. Can’t wait for it
"It&#39;s really cool, but I don&#39;t really see a reason to spend $4,000 dollars on it."
My brother in law was the manager of the Apple Vision Pro and he is very proud of it!
I really hope this goes the &quot;supersonic flight&quot; way.
Look at this distinguished gentleman look at the way he is sitting yes 🦁
"It&#39;s been shown that cell phones placed against your head can cause DNA damage to your cells in your brain. This thing sends signals directly Through Your Eyes into your brain. Technology wasn&#39;t developed so they can make us happy and entertain us. It is to track us and control us. Control?  If there&#39;s technology inside this headset that can hypnotize you.... without you knowing it... think about what they could make you do to yourself...... or to others. Fun fact, Apple sold its first computer for &quot;666&quot; dollars."
I made the mistake of showing my family this video <br><br>It&#39;s okay when you&#39;re just watching on your own but suddenly this video became incredibly boring when multiple people are watching <br><br>You repeated yourself a lot and said a very large amount of trivial things that had people sort of irritated waiting for anything to happen<br><br>Not hostile feedback but yeah <br>It was hard watching this with people waiting for something to happen and the waffle to chill out.
"Let&#39;s get real, these devices are created by geeks for geeks based on what looks cool etc..not based on solid marketing or usability. The makers and designers live in a bubble of their own unable perceive the usability of their creations outside their perceived reality. Sure, it&#39;s a device good for some things like gaming and multimedia. However, all the physical gestures required will literally get tiresome after a while. Not to mention the physical discomfort that results in wearing it more than 45min or so. Imagine putting that on a hot humid day! As I type this on my oversized smartphone, which I have been using 50min or so, the finger tips on the hand holding my phone are almost numb while my elbow is sore from resting on my desk. My point is.. this is a gimmick that will have niche adopters and not for the general public. Specially with that price point."
"This is a device that marks the new era of digital slavery and the final stage of human existence at the end times. People are getting dumbed down, are getting lost in meaningless and false visual environments while separating themselves even from their own family members and it is as frightening as it gets. I’m going back to my old Nokia dumb phone and notepad. I had enough."
"How can they create tech like this,  but they cant design a battery to last more than a few hours?"
"Far too big for all day, every day wearing.  But a few more years and it will become smaller and lighter. Then it will be integrated into our lives full time."
"Great review, Marques. Greetings all the way from Morocco."
Did i miss the part about if you need to use it with the lights on or not .

Can you use the eye tracking/finger pinchy thing instead of the trackpad on your Mac?
it&#39;s mean you have to have apple product to used it while I&#39;m always fan of Samsung and never used apple in my life.
"If any other company released a product like this, it would flop. the only reason it has anyone looking at it as a serious item is because it&#39;s apple.. Solid pass-through seems to be the only new technology the headset has brought to the VR world and even then, meta is close enough in their headsets pass through that it doesn&#39;t really justify spending 3-4k. Other headsets have high pixel density, other headsets have eye and face tracking, other headsets have hand tracking with the exact same touch based interface, and what&#39;s worse, projecting the screen in the headset was one of the earliest features VR headsets had... Based off everything you&#39;ve mentioned here, there&#39;s no real reason to spend money on the vision pro, it&#39;s just not that useful for anything that other VR headsets already have, and have done better. <br><br>One could argue that seamless integration with photos and other things on your devices is cool. Sure, but is it 4k dollars cool?"
Imagine someone robbing the apple store and using the apple vision pro and a mask to hide there identity 😂
okay. so I learnt that the HOLI festival this year falls on March 25th !!
Wait... I thought he got Cybernetic Enhancements?
this &quot;VR&quot; just awesome 😂
Cant wait for features to suddenly stop working after 2 years and having to buy a new one
"The way I see it for now? It is most useful if you use it to connect to your Mac for wide vision. A few more years needed so it can be fully immersable and completely useful for a wider set of users. Right now, I can&#39;t say I see innovation. I just see the hype. It is missing that &quot;Steve Job-Innvation feeling.&quot; It is plainly &quot;hype&quot;. Plus the price? lol! it&#39;s useless at the moment and probably will damage our eyes even faster."
"Cons, you said price, they laughed"
Imma get the vision pro in 5 years when they&#39;ve properly updated it. it sounds really cool tbh
Great thumbnail! The couple looks amazing together. Perfect girl with a perfect man! love you♥️🔥
Iphone 16-17 will have 120 Hz display!!

What is the use of vision pro
Poor me watching this 🙂
I have no use for this. So i&#39;ll pass.
Waiting for the VR than can provide the specs of a PC so i can play MMORPG lol
"<b>Yeahh, this is deff not worth 4,000. I&#39;ll be like the other devlopers who opted out to see whats to become of this product, then, i might buy it and utilize it once all the kinks are taken care of</b>"
peace
Me: Ain&#39;t no way I&#39;m watching this long ass video about a VR headset from Apple<br>37 minutes later:
I think Apple pro vision will be fun if you are stoned
"Its a great idea, but im not sure i like the idea of big tec having some much personal data on their servers, for one, your basically providing your own mug shot to allow you to be tracked by all the face recognition soft ware on CCTV systems"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=105"">1:45</a> &quot;This is a thing we&#39;ve have seen before&quot; <br>Basically everything apple made and claims is &quot;new&quot; and &quot;innovated&quot;"
WACKK
I thought the cable was removable. I think I saw that on LTT
Useless
God warned his children this day would come we already live in a false reality without VR
WOw! That Full Immersion dial switch is just 🤯 Mind blowing. Great product. Already
"This looks really cool! However, I just finished de-Appling myself because I was annoyed that they keep taking power tools away from their OSes and removing advanced features, and they didn&#39;t let me fully fix my last phone. We need something like this for the Android+Linux ecosystem!"

Isnt blue light super bad for your eyes?????
"Ok, really not an apple fan but this is amazing.<br>Is it somehow capable of realtime motion detection/tracking or night vision? Hmmm?"
Again way to come into the game late Apple and act like you invented it.
"cool! No repairs needed anymore. Just map your apartment and all it has in &quot;vision&quot; and let it be  some penthouse design. No cockroaches running around, no neighbors through the windows. no bad region of the city. Nothing matter. Just map it and live wherever you want. Soon no external repairs of building also will be necessary - the owner will just buy an online update and everyone seeing your house will see a brilliant house. both outside and inside."
is there an headphone plug ?
"can you easily operate it.. watch a movie, check your emails, while you are laid in your bed ? (with objects on the floor instead of in front of you), or laid in your bed on your side ?"
"This device is 100% not worth it, and if you buy the first generation of anything you might be a moron. The fact that I have to carry around an external battery pack to power this headset is absolutely stupid the second thing is people are complaining about eye strain. how the F are we not at 240 Hz in all of our devices that would reduce eye fatigue and strain like crazy. Simply put the technology just is not here yet and Apple is trying to push something that they have not mastered yet this device is 100% a waste of money"
This will be the most used useless tech of 2024
This thing is dumb. And dangerous
its a vr headset that does way less than any other vr headset
"IMHO we should really move away from mAh as a measure of battery capacity because 2 packs with the same mAh rating can wind up with 2-3 fold more or less energy in them depending on voltage. I&#39;ve already seen this cause confusion eg with an Anker battery I bought that has bad reviews for being 5Ah instead of the advertised 10Ah, which is technically true because it uses 2 5Ah cells in series instead of parallel. It has the same energy content as a traditional 10Ah battery but it&#39;s technically not 10Ah."
its the &#39;If you have a darker skin tone like me&#39; that finishes me.
Underwhelming
That fact it comes with a single strap instead of a duel strap is hysterical
Lol God when . 😢😂😂
Free Congo🇨🇩
Men of culture....<br>Im gonna need a review of the question we all have. <br>Thanks
Apple gets away with false advertising again.
"Total nonsense, It is still an expensive potato."
Wow that typing is horseshit. I would have atleast imagined it integrated with the $1500 iPhone in everyone’s pocket and can atleast utilize the iPhone as a controller or keyboard.
Okay a meta user here what is apples Vision Pro competition to meta Horizon Worlds? With persona?
Most definitely the future
Mark Zuckerberg wants reallife eye movement for his robots
government wants our eye prints
This thing sounds like an expensive recipe for a migraine
Would love to use this for trading
Wow
Idk man. Shit like this is just novelty to me.
You&#39;re more embarrassed by having a conversation than sitt next to someone looking like your conducting a virtual orchestra?<br>Ok.
I&#39;m surprised it wasn&#39;t showing the arc of the ping pong ball and approximating the trajectory of it. Imagine a police officer using it if facial recognition features are added that correlate with a database showing your criminal history. Or some creepy dude using it to &quot;undress&quot; people using ai. It&#39;s one of those kinds of devices that&#39;s going to have to be carefully regulated.
This video seriously blew up! 💣
Alhumdullilah ❤
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1845"">30:45</a> &quot;Aw man! We forgot to test this on black people!&quot;<br>- Apple"
I really wouldn&#39;t call it high end.. The fact that the battery pack is external and it being non-removable just shows how desperate they are to force people to spend money on their proprietary trash! Secondly is the lack of controllers. We all know Apple isn&#39;t really made for gaming but at that price point you&#39;d expect it to run games and come with controllers. The Quest 3 is way more versatile and just a fraction of the cost!
thx for the helpful introduction!!
"if my eyes have cylinder, does it still comfortable or not? because if im watching 3D movie on cinema, its really not comfortable, still have to wearing my glasses and then wearing 3D glasses, so yes, double glasses 😅"
You missed the best feature: capturing and playing back spacial video of your friends/family/kids. That&#39;s the killer &quot;game changing&quot; app. You can relive your own moments in immersive 3D like you are there again. Also missed pointing out that iPhone 15Pro can record spacial video format for Vision Pro. Admittedly at a lower resolution than the Vison Pro itself captures spacial video.
pass
"Me watching this, knowing i will never be able to buy it."
Good Review !!
Tbh I&#39;d prefer apple vision pro instead of meta quest just because the fact that i dont like the ideas of a giant battery  at the back of my head
PLAYER 1 MOVIE WAS JUST A SENSITIZE.... HERE WE GO!
Why I&#39;m watching this video I don&#39;t even have an iPhone 😢
"Say you&#39;re watching a video like a music concert video. Can the headset make it so you&#39;re in a full 360 3D environment of the concert?<br><br>I&#39;m guessing not, just yet. But that would be a great feature."
Also... you can&#39;t comfortably drink coffee without clunking the bottom of the headset with the mug.
You can&#39;t do a virtual screen for mac if you have an older laptop! Back it goes!
Lockheed Martin and every military company needs to join Apple to develop this headset to the moon
Needs mouse n keyboard accessory to use faster or gaming controller
I think this is a good social tool as well some rich kids can let poor kids play with this vr set and become friends
I fully support this technology it will advance beyond our imagination and its useful for military truck drivers even welders if it can increase enough tint
It needs a soft strap that goes over the top of ur head it&#39;s too much weight on the nose in its current form
It&#39;s good sunglasses for truckers especially if it has special anti glare technology
I&#39;m assuming if you look down at an android phone the phone is censored with a mosaic filter.
Personas?  More like giving the FBI and the CIA every last detail of you that they&#39;ll EVER NEED willingly.  As if the invention of Facebook and fingerprint unlocking wasn&#39;t bad enough!  😂
"Tons of potential, but also still has tons of let downs.  Of course it&#39;ll be a status symbol for those that don&#39;t feel that 4 grand is a lot of money, <br>but for the larger majority I feel that it&#39;s just not fully ready yet to become a staple in our homes.  I feel like it&#39;s price point should be more like<br>$1200-1800.  Paying more than twice that is absurd at this point.  But again.. if you throw money around like it&#39;s nothing.. then of course it&#39;ll<br>be a cool thing to have.  Until then, I&#39;ll just stick to my out dated Iphone 11 Pro Max."
&quot;If it&#39;s a url that you can actually say out loud&quot;
It’s cool and all and interesting. But let’s be real. If this catches on it’ll be a nightmare for humanity as a whole for many reasons. I will never buy one of these.

Very cool video so far! I&#39;ll come back to it and comment some more later.
"It <b>IS</b> AR, because anything like that has to use cameras to blend the graphics with the real-world space. My first encounter with AR is with my Nintendo 3DS, and that&#39;s exactly what it does. And then I think I&#39;ve seen AR in others of these headsets but I can&#39;t remember for sure. Another time AR entered my life was when I played a walk-through video game at a mall with their cell phones. Yep, I don&#39;t know how it would work without being able to blend a camera image with its superimposures."
"&quot;...And it even sometimes casts a shadow on the ground...&quot;<br><br>...except that we&#39;d have to be outside to see that, rather than watching that happen to a coffee table or the floor."

"Why dont they just put away all the electronic parts seperate from the goggle itself except the screen like what they did to the battery and add a keypad function like to nokia 3310 so it will be less heavy, less bulky on your head and you will not look like a moron trying to touch the air, or perhaps an application in iphone that will connect to your goggle so basically the goggle is just a screen without any functions without connecting it to your phone using the cable wire."
"What Nobody mentions, not even Marques, is that the eyetracking is Marketing Gold, imagine knowing how long your eyeballs gazed on an ad,  if you just ignored it, if you gased for 5 to 10 seconds and then clicked on it,<br><br>You want consumer data to sell? these will give you data for years and years to come<br><br>Not to mention when it comes to designing the new Pixar pic, the next Marvel Movie, evaluating wether that new 5 million  dollar Micheal Bay scene caught peoples eyes, wether their pupils dialated, what elements they where looking at throught, imagine!<br><br>They really should lower the price, that data will pay for itself, with every Apple TV production, they&#39;ll get more and more data and could corner that market!"
I’m just exited for the future models
headache or eyestrain???
This actually the beginning of the Technology of Tony Stark Glasses given to Peter Parker.  aka Spider Man.
When will you stop apple simping bro.
"How far we&#39;ve come... really impresses me the fact we can do all these things and keep going to a 100% virtual world, which is kinda scary btw. Nice video man, really appreciate your effort on ti!"
This video deserves a lot of likes ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"We know that cell phone batteries cause various cancers, so what affect will the tiny battery have on the brain?"
For 5 grand it better feel high end
2nd most popular video in 2 weeks 💪
lol ama wait till it gets cheaper like the phones 😊
"If Matrix movie was made in today&#39;s time, Neo could enter the matrix using this device."
Say bye to your freedoms...they will control you and people are to brainwashed to see it
&quot;The product you don&#39;t really need&quot;
Mindblowing
There is no way I&#39;m the only one that thinks this is a rip off. 🤣🤣.  No YouTube no Netflix. Android should definitely retaliate.
yea i dont expect much software to be made for a device with a market cap of like 2000 people
this thing was predicted in back to the future 2
Crazy and well done Marques
MAY LORD HAVE MERCY
I recon this would be epic for Pokémon Go. Imagine walking down the street and seeing a Gym or Poké stop in 3D you can interact with and Pokémon running out in front of you.
Reviewing Apple product whlie using S24 Ultra 😂👏👏👏
"It&#39;s a good product, but considering watching movies and videos in such an immersive experience was one of the unique selling points of the Vision Pro, it&#39;s kind of disappointing that netflix and youtube won&#39;t be on it"
bro called it &quot;brain cycles&quot;. he&#39;s fully integrated.
"I returned mine. Its not worth a fraction of what it costs. It you decide to get into VR, I hate to say it but go with meta. It’s price alone puts it miles above the apple vision pro"
no thx horrible thing
What stupid device
"I look in amazement at what the Vision Pro is capable of, but the learning curve seems huge. Not sure I could ever figure it out. <br>🥽❓"
"Imagine apple partnered with app studios like Ninja Kiwi to bring games like Balloons Tower defense 3D to your coffee table, or ofc your toilet. Then id pay 4k."
I hope this is not future
"I am imagining when it will support two Macs, and when it does, I will buy two Macs and a Vision Pro to do the work and exciting things on Vision Pro at the same time with work"
"this is what Tony Stark felt like in Iron man I. This gives off said vibes, Jarvis bring up the sciency thingy hahaha..."
"&gt; &quot;They want you to default to putting the battery in your back pocket&quot;<br>&gt; Puts the battery in his front pocket, fits perfectly<br><br>Please respect the person at Apple who&#39;s spent the last three years researching back pockets"
But what if you have like a eye problem like needing glasses to see near objects. Wouldn&#39;t that affect wearing a Vision pro?
Help me 😢
Help me get one PLEASE IF YOU SEE THIS
So what if you open netflix on your mac then get the vision pro conected to the mac 🤔
I am all ready an avatar in my body. 👽
"This is like cyberpunk edgerunner where they just pickup calls and messages in their eyes so there’s no need for phones anymore, you could also change your fov in real life now lol"
i hope it´ll be achievable for everyone in the future
When will they invent sword art online tech
People really have no life. Leave all those craps and go enjoy real life and some sun outside. You&#39;ll be happier 😂
"Not through the video yet, but judging by apps so far, basically this thing is a $ 4,000 iPad? Man, these Apple guys are geniuses."
This sucks lol. There&#39;s no use for such thing in a real world. Great presentation thought.
i have a squint in one eye do yo think this will work for me ?
"Probably a very silly question but.....What about people with glasses? Do you wear this thing without your glasses on, and if so does the device adjust for the lack of vision? Or is this product exclusively for those with perfect vision already?"
"What people are forgetting is that a healthy person&#39;s peripheral vision is 180 degrees, and Apple Vision Pro gives you 110. So when you fool yourself that you have a big screen in front of you, that feeling is compared to your newly adapted peripheral vision, which is actually pretty small compared to your actual peripheral vision. So Apple users, do not kid yourselves with those measurements. I saw a reviewer saying he does not need a bigger screen in front of him because he is forced to look right and left. 😅 And he forgets the fact that it is the lack of that device&#39;s capability, not yours. 😂 So please stop comparing Apple Vision&#39;s monitor illusions to an actual super ultrawide monitor that fills your entire actual peripheral vision."
There are air intakes around your nose area with exhausts above your eyes .... do they filter the air in readiness for the next respiratory pandemic?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1740"">29:00</a> at least it makes you smile"
"imaging you at the bus stop with that thing on ,,"
Not being able to wear glasses might be a huge problem.
The educational applications of this technology is mindblowing...
This dude sounds like his name Tanner
Damn... VTubers are gonna be crazy now
"This is a great wake-up call that shows how our resources and energy have been misused in society. We have technology that can create a Hollywood blockbuster film out of thin air, but a can of soup still costs $3.95."
amazing AR+VR implementation
Excellent Review. Does anyone else feel like this product is a complete waste of money and resources? I think I am getting too old for this world...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1707"">28:27</a> you help it like an iphone, the voice however said to hold it at eye level!"
"The thing I like about Apple is they&#39;ve been such forward thinkers, so I think &quot;spatial computing&quot; is a really good name for this technology. Just the features with the facetime calls or zoom meetings makes you wonder how good it&#39;ll be once the vision 2 or 3 comes out. By that time there will probably be more app capability"
Wonder if he felt any nausea while using it?  Any VR headset so far I&#39;ve used I felt nausea after only 15 min use that last for hours after removing it off my face.
Life about to be like Altered Carbon
"Nice review. Seems like a huge waste of money to me, no practical use in everyday life."
Take a bite from the apple at your own risk.
Just came to say LoL after watching a video of someone making fun of it.
The ladder in the background is really distracting
Dude... the best review I&#39;ve seen of this yet... sweet i have not liked Apple products before very much but this one... seems pretty dang fun... the price though... dayum... might have to wait a bit but... you definitely seem to have sold it to me!
crap tech
"ok guys idk if its a coincidence or something, im watching mr robot again and in s2 ep4 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=781"">13:01</a> in the train a girl is wearing apple vision pro, and that episode was released in july 27 2016..."
Worst pice of equipment humans ever created! This will destroy society
Me watching this with -2.5 $ in my bank 💀
I’m impressed 😂
The conferencing capability is really cool. And makes total sence. For companys big telepresence system like a Cisco TX9000 or Poly RealPresence are around half a million dollars excluding installation (and use for the room). So this is super interesting. And of course the usual AR/VR training and presentation use cases.
It would be cool to use street view in a free roaming type of set up
Must have water mark in  video.
I will wait for Android vision pro
Do you need every apple  product.
Whenever you put it on it looks like the dude from Ready Player One lol
"As computers get smaller and more powerful these innovations will get cooler and even kinda scary. Not an Apple user but this device looks hella awesome and innovated. This could be the future, but for now walking with this would look absolutely ridiculous! 🤣👍(I could totally see myself chilling with the full immersion setting with music playing in the background lol... that sounds dystopian holy crap)"
bro turned into a apple npc
"No Youtube, No Netflix, No Spotify, bad comfort and short battery life. Yeah that&#39;s a instant no no. I was never an apple fan, so I&#39;ll never spend on something like that. Just better buy a PC with that amount of money lol."
"first it was a desktop then a laptop and now head top<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>"
"This is so cool, like it&#39;s absolutely not for me for so many reasons, but as someone that grew up with cassette players and CRT TVs, this is kind of mindblowing how far we&#39;ve come lol."

I will not be using these goggles. Not getting my eye matrix copied and stolen. My own personal security risk!! VERY RISKY!!
Next time force ghost persona filter
Readers+Android = Apple vision pro
Cool enough but i wouldnt pay that much for it
"Your hands trought the headset lens looks like a simulation, not the real hands. It looks funny."
"Wild, it really looks like the future. If I could play PCVR games with it, I&#39;d want it."
Im kinda blown away apple would even bother developing this
I feel like needing to look at the thing you are controlling is stupid and un efficient
One thing similar in ad and reality dark skin 😂
"Looked amazing until you mentioned the price point 😮 not as adventurous as you, need some decent reasons to spend that cash"
too bad apple sucks
"Its like your just a pasted animation of what it recorded on setup, and the mic has it own coded work to move what it grabbed on setup for your person."
just called it hybrit end off discution
Headache?
Did anyone already comment it mA*h doesn’t measure the energy. mWt*h does. So you need to multiply it by the Voltage do get the energy. It has higher voltage than standard power banks for smartphones
"So they where relaunching the same phone since 2010 just changing the price and removing features to fund this thing, heh?"
For all the data they will be stealing from us these things should be free I rather go do real life activities with my time and money
I eat chicken
How long till someone hacks the personas so you end up talking to hello kitty during your work meeting.
Apple going to find a way to drop the Vision Pro max in a year
Goodbye peoples social life and human Interaction
ReadyPlayerOne right on schedule
so you figured out why?
i guess i changed my mind. I wouldn&#39;t mind it that much to have a chip brain implant
Gay!
I really enjoy your way of speaking. So clean
Thanks for the great easy to follow videos..! Worth a sub! Just wondering when it will be coming to the uk? 🎉
"This is nothing but impressive. It&#39;s a similar technological leap to iPhone 1, and with an equally high degree of refinement of ideas and execution. Steve would be proud."
"This is going to be only a niche product...the price is waaaaay to high for what it delivers, yes it&#39;s good quality, but really, who in the real world is going to spend that much on what really is just a fancy ipad...a handful of die-hard apple fans yes, but it&#39;s not going to convert anybody using existing PCVR or standalone headsets that are as good, if not better in many ways, and have a massive catalogue of apps and experiences already in place to utilise."
"You are wrong, removing cable is not the only way to turn off vision. Press both the buttons on the top at the same time, and it will ask you to turn off power. @marques"
Advanced Tech IS Magic.
If we showed this to someone in the 1700s they would think it&#39;s magic
"these are absolutely awesome, tech is definitely improving wow"
they need to open up their soft to independent developers more. That&#39;s where the cool shit is gonna happen.

"man, i too love the &quot;Ready Player One&quot; series too! glad none of this is real :D"
Great video. Well done. I also like that while you’re talking apple integration you’re featuring a Samsung phone for your video notes.
Please buddy stop using it. Areas covered by it not getting sunlight. Specially dont use it outside under direct sunlight or in nice summer trip. <br>Soon everyones face is going to turn into something similar after removing bikini 😁🤣😁
No youtube nope i wont buy it until they add at least youtube
"As a crypto enthusiast, Xeventy&#39;s concept really resonates with me. Investing in the presale for sure!"

well covered:)
"imho using VR headsets anything other than immersive gaming, feels a lttle &#39;&#39;forced&#39;&#39; to me. You can watch movies in a real screen rather than a virtual one, yo can read messages, open music or play candy crush on your phone, rather than your virtual floating screen. Using VR for these things is like using it for saying i am using it. But there is no other way than VR headset to feeling like sitting inside a racing car. Affordable way at least, if you are rich you can build a 100k simulator setup :D"
"VR Gaming ????? If I&#39;m going to spend 4 Grand on a headset, I need to know how well it does with Steam VR??? How (and how well) do games control ?  Every other feature is just uber-cool gadgetry, not (imo) worth paying 4 Grand for when there are other pro-level alternatives in a lower price space.<br>I know Apple hates to focus attention on gaming, but it is a large portion of the headset demographic. Also, how well does it interconnect with non-Apple hardware for us mere humans?"
"I think the future version will be a light helmet with everything integrated, airpods,vision pro and the chip of Elon😮"
that persona part was like some a fcked up  black mirror thing.
Have you or anyone with one tried to use it to decorate a room let&#39;s say. Can you take furniture from a pic or store etc.. and place it into the room to see what it will look like?
I find it cool
A battery discharging while chargimg kills the max life of the battery rather rapidly.
"so you can have a legal hallucination about the reality. You can live in a boring town, but work next to a river in the mountain (until you take the Vision Pro off). This things makes h€ro1n useless."
"The world doesn&#39;t need VR.<br>AR though could be interesting, a new and better, lighter, Google Glass"
Imagine gaming with this. Using the controller ofcourse
"They are isolating us more and more, we don’t need this crap"
I hope blood flow to our face or eyes is smooth like we&#39;re not wearing it.
They are the game changers!!!!
"With all these cool new augmented reality headsets coming out, I wonder if it is worth it to buy a new TV?"
u use android...shame on u :)
"OMG, Marques Bro It&#39;s Truth. <br>I Was Not To Awareness."
watching from my quest 3
"It&#39;s a pity that it has to be labeled as a &#39;spatial computer&#39; instead of being recognized as Apple&#39;s AR/VR device with controllers. I would prefer Apple to compete with Quest 3, leveraging the power of the M2 chip, micro-OLED screens, and their superior tracking quality. This could enable games like Resident Evil Village to reach PS5 quality on a wireless device."
This is a lot of tech to do basically nothing important.
And here we thought Google Glass looked nerdy.
Time to goon with this
Remarking on the thumb nail. Left: Diving goggles. Right: Those glasses from the &#39;V&#39; series.
This is cool and also absolutely scary!
You could use YouTube on your laptop via these
"The Missing Piece: a review of what happens if you use VR for an extended time, especially for full-time work environments. Back in the 1990&#39;s I was at a seminar featuring Maxine Brown of UIC&#39;s ImmersaDesk. Wearing no headset, and seated at a non-VR table, she was unable to speak without her hands floating around her, memory-driven, as if plucking information within her VR space. Now ... I test at 99% Spatial Reasoning, and would adore using VR for everything ... but having seen her inability to disengage her body enough to retrieve thoughts and vocalize without that accompanying physical mimic ... made me realize I would never really want to go down such a virtual rabbit hole when I already enjoy an internal spatial vr-type-ability on my own. I felt sad for her artificial VR tick, but also felt free and at peace for myself over a technology I&#39;d (needlessly) yearned over for decades.,"
"Simply put why it sucks. I already hate having to wear eye glasses. Wearing this, even worse. Gesture instead of move wrist and just a click of a mouse, is reall shitty. I wouldn&#39;t buy this if it were $50. $25 maybe"
The moment you realize you&#39;re already wearing the headset
Apple fan boy
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1599"">26:39</a> That&#39;s because in the ads, the camera is not looking from an angle upwards to the user. The camera must be facing the Apple Vission Pro directly!"
Can you send me vision pro gift me
"The Vision Pro <b>could be</b> the best &quot;mobile phone/music pod/internet/gaming device&quot; of the decade! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1955"">32:35</a><br>But <b>its price is the Real Killer!!!</b>"
"In the 1920&#39;s: We&#39;ll have flying cars and no disease or famine!<br>2024: Look, TV that you can wear on your head!"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1801"">30:01</a> Can&#39;t wear my glasses? Fuuhhhhh"
Okay but what if you were talking to yourself or just talking making noise and you see a shadow start to appear but you are alone 😮😮😮
Best tech review ever
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1602"">26:42</a> I feel like nobody&#39;s talking about the fact that the displayed eyes also sit higher on your face than in reality (at certain angles, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1593"">26:33</a>, they even look like they&#39;re on your forehead; in general, though, they look 1-3 cm higher at all times), adding to the uncanny-valley feeling.  I&#39;m interested why Apple didn&#39;t want to make them appear lower (more lifelike)."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1568"">26:08</a> &quot;The fog of w...&quot; -- me: he&#39;s not actually going to say &#39;war&#39;, right? -- &quot;....hatever&quot;  -- OHHH"
"It’s a VR headset, plain and simple!"
"Why is no one talking about the battery on the headset other MKBHD here??? While the wire hangs around (like it is 80s and wires are hanging from headset to the walkman), battery lasts only measly horrible 2 hours... 2 ... hours... like, seriously? I am afraid to ask what is the charging time to be honest... but all in all - not my cup of tea... movin on..."
Great overview.
will there be a p hub app for this?
"I think I see where this is going. The vision pro will become an accessory to smaller, portable mac computers; they&#39;re liking keeping the battery separate to train their customers to get used to carrying something around. A separate computer piece would allow versatility in how it&#39;s used; both VR/AR and desktop modes, as well as allow the actual headset to shrink and become more comfortable."
So can you wear glasses with it and what if you have no arms?
why does the mac have a windows background???
"The hand calibration reminded me of the Community VR episode. “Calibrate the system by looking at your hands, then turning them over and looking at the back of your hands with a sense of wonder.” 😂"
I fell like as we keep getting more and more tech slammed in our faces the more I just want to go back and live in the 90s.
"Apple is <b>CORRECT</b> not to call it a VR headset because it&#39;s a AR headset - <b>AUGMENTED REALITY</b> headset! Explaination: In VR, EVERYTHING is created digitally, hence VR videogames. On the other hand - <b>Augmented REALITY</b> shows you the <b>REAL world</b> ...but enhances it by adding a hud , text, colors, icons etc. for you to spot <b>real life objects</b> easier! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=775"">12:55</a> Ignore what I sadi! 😵‍💫"
Have you ever seen the Magic Leap AR headset?
Can the display for MAC feature work with shell closed?

"Nice video, as a noob I just dont see a use case for this longterm. Gaming on a 500 usd Quest 3 with some good titles to go with it, great hobby. But spending 3,5k usd on this without any great apps/ games at launch? What does watching a Youtube video on an augmented moon give me more than my PC setup? Apple products usually aint a good investment but this sounds like a very expensive niche product to me. Then theres all the practical limitations of having a headset on when the task could very well be done with a normal screen setup much more comfortable..."
Soon we will play Sword art online😂
"as a proof of concept, this is the first step of an awesome AWESOME technolgy."

"I actually, literally like this video<br><br><br>.... 🎉🎉"
Pupils and charging
it&#39;s uncanny because of the eyes. they&#39;re too bright
Vr is such an overhyped scam
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=120"">2:00</a>... I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll figure out how to make them lighter/smaller so ladies won&#39;t get a MIGRAINE from wearing them. Until then I won&#39;t try any of these huge VR headsets"
"One huge downside is practicality. As well as the Mac Connect thing or the Apple Music app works on the Vision Pro, tell me, how many times are you actually going to go through the effort of putting a whole half a kilogram aluminum case on your head and charge it additionally, carrying it in a case that’s like 5 times thicker than your MacBook. <br><br>VR/AR headsets are exactly where they were about ten years ago: cool gimmicks that’ll just collect dust after the first month or so of usage.<br><br>The only way VR/AR picks up is if they manage to shrink it to a smaller form factor with all day battery life. The former, Google already tried with Google Glasses and were partly successful but with the battery technology storage today, no way it’s gonna be possible to store all day battery life in a package that small. <br><br>And above all, charging absurd amounts, upwards of 3000 dollars is gonna steer people away all the more, it’ll be nothing more than a shiny toy."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=903"">15:03</a> wdym marques 😂😂😂 wdym 😂😂😂😂😂"
"Let&#39;s be honest, these are gonna be used to watch porn and binge TikToks. Apple and other companies will use these to further track your every single move and behaviors and you will no longer even own your thoughts. <br>You will loose that last part of your humanity and further disconnect you from the actual world until you have no relation to it. <br><br>The tech on display here is awesome for sure, but it will be used for sinister and predatory purposes and we will see suicide rates and depression on a scale we have yet to even fathom if these are to replace our phones. <br>Don&#39;t buy into your own doom. Slow things down in your life, be more assertive with your time and actions. Stay in reality for a while and you will be better off for it."
Can turn off with the headset buttons &amp; immersively.  You don&#39;t simply pull the power - and ma6be shouldn&#39;t.
You are not in Augmented Reality.
"I am wondering .. like I saw in an ad, people wearing shuch headset are walking on road and pinching doing their stuff simultaneously. If for some reason, the camera feed screen fails to refresh, and the person doesn&#39;t catch this immediately. And if he was crossing road in hurry, a vehicle which is still away as per the headset, would crash with him in realtime."
Why would you willingly give away all your biometric data to a company so you could be hacked at any time?
"I dont get these &quot;personas&quot; or avatars... Just put my actual face there. Sounds like a solution in search of a problem. Also the outside looking screen and sensors that are only for facial recognition are expensive power hungry dead weights. And that is coming from me, a sci-fi lover..."
These are very expensive in Pakistan🙄
So the Apple Vision Pro is racist
"It has been very long since I saw such an impressive, fresh video, kudos to the product and the presenter."
Awesome ❤
You can shut it off while using it without taking the plug out
The battery comments are surprisingly ignorant for the caliber of this channel and Jerryrigeverything explained it quickly. It&#39;s bcz the voltage is much higher. You have to look at power in Wh not mAh
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1216"">20:16</a> see yeah"
This is insane!! Bro I can hook up to the computer and play games while having I music and discord open
Just stumbled on your review and channel. My only comment/perspective (slight at best): This is like FPV to me as when you are placing your body into the imaginary cockpit of a drone you are augmenting your reality. I wonder if that learning curve is lessened?
This is the dumbest tech I&#39;ve seen in awhile lol
This product should be banned
Actually the headset can be turned off. <br>Press and hold the crown and the top button simultaneously for about 4seconds while wearing the headset and the option to switch off will appear. <br>You can also shut it down through the general tab in settings.<br>Thank me later.
The Apple Vision Pro are cool for a day or two. Then you realise that you paid 4.000 for the experience and that they are almost useless....
One of the best video I watched. I like how you were able to provide a lot of details about this product. I am definitively getting one Apple Visio Pro. Thank you!
One of the best tech reviews ive ever seen. i wasn&#39;t bored a bit and half and hour passed like it was 10 to 12 minute. great video as always
Was an amazing overview loved how the shadow appeared under window. Unfortunately after 3 fittings I had to return mine as it kept putting pressure on my sinuses and would give me a pressure headache. I&#39;m sure this is not everyone&#39;s experience I hope it gets resolved so I can get anyone.
"Great review - my interest level is just slightly increased … some promising steps for the future - but currently I’m thinking ‘oh my neck’, lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=288"">4:48</a> the battery is 13v so the low mAh makes sense, the energy is still abt the same as a 10 000 mah power bank (also the voltage is interesting, it might actually be lithium iron phosphate cells in there)"
This video convinced me to get an Apple Vision Pro. If I had the money.
fisher price vr.... noipe.
Fucking hell 30 seconds of ads 😮
it needs to adjust for presbyopia somehow without additional lenses.
"Bruhhh, i feel like I&#39;m not ready for the future at alll"

White countries matter

I dunno why I just watched this whole thing I dont even care about VR headsets
Does it work if you’re white as well?
"Have you ever used Steam in VR? Things that stay in place are not new, that&#39;s how you walk around VR rooms without running into the wall. So this thing tracks your eyes (HTC 2017), it has a better camera, and knows when you pinch your fingers... I&#39;ll wait for the Chinese or Android knock-off."
"thats actually amazing cool, won&#39;t buy but very cool"
"yow, can&#39;t wear that in the streets of San Fran....it will snatched right away .."

Cool another thing we don’t fucking need!!
Awesome intro. Thanks!
Ive never understood a topic like today <br>Bro is a born lecturer
They look like the ones in the movie Ready Player One
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1845"">30:45</a> Least racist apple product lol"
"Is there w version for white people too? Because I only see as you call it &quot;people of colour&quot; on ads, reviews and everything else connected with those apple thing....<br><br><br>Also if you consider buyin it - don&#39;t. I&#39;m not judging quality, but there&#39;s no app for those googles. You don&#39;t even have dedicated netflix app"
Idiocracy was not kidding about Frito&#39;s on the future!!
Still cost prohibitive. for 3500 I need some extreme everyday functionality
if it&#39;s a URL that you can say out loud 🤣🤣
Sadness
😂🤮🤮🤮
I looked up the price on the Apple vision pro and the price I seen was $3499. I sure hope the price drops to a more affordable number. For the average person $3500 is just to high of a price for the average consumer to afford. That being said the Apple vision pro does look very impressive.
You can turn it off without disconnecting the battery
Is this not going to make people lose their eye sight faster? We humans are so delicate. Something horrible is going to come from this.
can you type on a real physical keyboard while using the viz pro?
hello
Excellent.
What if you wear glasses?
"if i don´t poop gold nuggets while wearing that thing, i don´t need it...."
"I&#39;m not in the Apple environment and I&#39;m not going to drop the kind of cash to pick one of these up but the design is truly impressive. Really well thought out and excellent execution. Does it work for people who are long or short sighted and would normally need glasses?<br><br>What would be really impressive would be a fully immersive map app that can overlay the real world and give you directions. If that app can also adjust light levels so you can basically see in the dark like a cat then it would break reality in the best way.<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to 20 years from now and we&#39;ll probably have something the size and weight of Google glass but all the functionality of the Vision Pro and integrates AI seamlessly. Just walking down the street and your AI assistant reminds you to pick up something your wife asked you for earlier that evening as you walk past a grocery store. Then you hear a song coming from a store you&#39;re walking past and you ask the AI what it&#39;s called and it tells you and starts playing it. You&#39;re thirsty and it suggests a juice bar nearby and overlays foot prints out in front of you to direct you. You walk past a scrolling news headline and you ask the AI to read out some of the stories as you walk. Then the battery dies and you realise you can&#39;t remember where you parked and simply forgot how to function without a headset since everyone does everything through them."
3’000 not worth it I’m alright I’ll stick to reality but is cool!!!
&quot;GLASS&quot; guess you never watched jerry rig everything break it down huh?
"Why the hell microsoft has HoloLens 2 already 5 years ago no one cares, even better. But when apple releases something that costs 3 times as much, everyone pisses themselves."
"1. **Revolutionary Design**: The iPhone 100 could feature a sleek, ultra-thin, and flexible design, possibly utilizing advanced materials like graphene or carbon nanotubes.<br><br>2. **Holographic Display**: A holographic display that projects images and interfaces in three dimensions without the need for a physical screen, offering immersive augmented reality experiences.<br><br>3. **Neural Interface**: Integration of neural interface technology allowing users to interact with the device using their thoughts, enabling seamless communication and control.<br><br>4. **Quantum Processor**: A quantum processor that provides unprecedented computational power, enabling complex tasks such as real-time language translation, advanced AI, and simulations.<br><br>5. **Self-Healing Materials**: Incorporation of self-healing materials to repair minor damages automatically, ensuring the device maintains its pristine condition over time.<br><br>6. **Wireless Charging Over Air**: Advanced wireless charging technology that can charge the device over the air, eliminating the need for physical charging ports or pads.<br><br>7. **Biometric Security Advancements**: Enhanced biometric security features such as retina scanning, DNA recognition, or brainwave authentication for unparalleled device security.<br><br>8. **Environmental Sensing**: Built-in environmental sensors that monitor air quality, temperature, and other factors to provide users with real-time environmental data and alerts.<br><br>9. **Endless Battery Life**: Breakthroughs in battery technology that offer virtually unlimited battery life through advanced energy harvesting or highly efficient energy storage solutions.<br><br>10. **Global Connectivity**: Seamless integration with global communication networks, enabling high-speed internet access and connectivity in even the most remote regions of the world.<br><br>While these features may seem far-fetched today, technological advancements and innovation could potentially make them a reality in the distant future. The iPhone 100 would likely represent the pinnacle of mobile technology, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of design, functionality, and user experience."
Those avatars are decades away from approaching the uncanny valley. They look like pc game characters from 2004 😅
you have nice video and I like the way you review but your videos have way too many ads
The gadget is not as superb as  Your presentation. The output that we see through the gadget is all like AI generated content and does not look real and virtual specifically while doing face time.
Nice one ❤🔥
Once we get flying cars then I&#39;ll be impressed.
i feel like it falls into the realm of AR more than VR still
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👐
Bruhh someone should build around place for flaying monitor around you😮 hope that real
Scary there gonna clone us ahha
Can I still create multiple desktops within the mac and just swipe between them with three finger swipe?
❤❤ amazing ❤❤
Can we use physical keyboard instead of the virtual keyboard ?
Nintendo did it first
No YouTube are you serious lol
will buy the 8th version for sure.
"I already knew I didn&#39;t want one of these, but after seeing what it can do, I still don&#39;t want one. I&#39;m sure Apple will be fine even if it&#39;s the next Newton."

That direction of the caller&#39;s voice is a game changer I&#39;ve been waiting to come. It helps our brains to decipher information who&#39;s talking and what when there are multiple voices in a group call.
actually the correct term to be used here is a mixed reality headset
"Nice video! It just confirms me I really don&#39;t need that gadget. Apple has credits for creating first smart phone, that is for sure, but I don&#39;t think they will survive another decade or two. Obsolescence, too much greed, closed environment that will not communicate with other companies, products and services, don&#39;t seem to me a way to the future."
"So it does all the things a Meta Quest 1,2 &amp; 3 can do but without good games."
Look the new glasshole!!!!
After watching your full review. I finally decided to keep my old phone as I realizef it gives me more immersion and control just by holding my phone in front of my face. Saves me 3500 as well
maybe... for 350$. :D 3500 for that? LoL :D

You&#39;d think differently about the glass and metal after watching Jerry rigs everything
On my wish list is an Apple Vision Pro
Greetings from Ukraine. I really like your amazing review. Subscribed
🙄
The dumbest and most useless thing Apple has produced so far (you can tell that Steve Job&#39;s genius is fading out regrettably) and its horribly expensive too. There are more performant and less heavy VR devices out there.
Can&#39;t wait to hear about all the new cases of brain cancer that people have no idea why is happening 😅.
so it does not suport usbc even tho usbc would be capable of handeling both the power and data requirments that headset could have the eu should have rejected this headset
This item looks impressive and completely pointless
"I love that wooden coffee table shown in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=582"">9:42</a>, could anybody tell me the model and link to seller? thanks"
Surely there must be at least 1 game available on this thing!
"Apple has beautiful products. For example, their earphones that give you brain tumors after prolonged use due to the high radiation!"
it isn&#39;t coming out where I live until early 2025 (that&#39;s what the estimastion says atleast) and I&#39;m stoked to try them out. Could you give me your set lmao?
I think this is the most depressing video EVER lol
Cable from battery is removable with a sim ejector. It’s a lightning cable.
"when we have Vison Pro 5, ill get a vision pro 3."
is there any legislation on using this while driving yet?
You can play the video on background. Try it guys
just take a minute ... and realise what acutal humanity where able to create !
&quot;If it&#39;s a URL that you can say out loud&quot; 😂
speaking of killer apps... does it run visicalc?
Totally omissed any mention of gaming. dislike
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=435"">7:15</a> Question about hands: what if someone comes up behind you and extends their arm into your field of vision and starts pinching around, could they mess with your screens? or does it only respond to your hands knowing which hands are yours?"
I would have thought the battery would be something of a non-issue. It&#39;s literally no different then wearing wired headphones.
"So spends 4k can’t watch Netflix or YouTube. And according to this doofus people will spend 4k for ecosystem? Bruv Application compatibility is a must have people won’t spend 4k just for an immersive work space experience unless it does what it’s meant for which is watching movies series and yt videos, watching them on browser is not same as on an application also  tv doesn’t have all the movies or shows which other apps have. So other applications should be there for it to fulfill its purpose."
This is one of the best reviews of the vision pro on the tubes.  Great job
"one question, if you are calling someone on the facetime, why dont you just show you as yourself instead of this persona?"
Interesting review lol.  It&#39;s cool but i dont see this being the future of technology
Incredible
Does wearing prescription glasses make a difference?
compare it with Microsoft hololens and google lens
Wow 3000$ to send imessage from a VR headset
"Your review is great! Straight to the point, in-depth enough, very sharp. Thanks!"
IRON MAN
I am really relieved that they have separated the battery I really don&#39;t want the battery blow up against my face.
2nd most popular video on your channel must be a 10/10 vid
seems we are almost there..
Make sense 10 years time this will be alot smaller and smarter thank God for  tech
"If you&#39;re going to have an external battery, why not have a big one that lasts more than 2 hours?"
"This is amazing.<br>Still a little rudimentary, but at least a massive step in the right direction.<br><br>I imagine that this will end up being the Google Glass that Google glass wasn&#39;t.<br>A simpler, sleeker version of it appearing a few years from now.<br>Hopefully, by then, they will have ironed out the smaller things like multiple finger typing and the Somewhat creepy Avatars...<br><br>I hope this does really well."
i only would suggest: put a nose on it because motion seekness
I want it!
Me being broke watching to see if any 100% discounts😂😂😂
Its a lemon...
"its not vr, its actually AR"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1318"">21:58</a> actually the virtual screens are quite certainly not having a 4K resolution unless you move them so close that a single screen fills up the entire FOV of the Vision Pro. If the resolution per eye is around 4K  a virtual screen will only have a resolution of 1080p even when it fills up 1/4 of the entire FOV which is actually still quite a big screen to work on."
try to use it while driving and get/follow directions (if it supports)
The battery cable is removable it’s a hidden lighting cable
It will get rid of physical tvs within 10 years
"It&#39;s still fascinating and both baffling at the same time how people blindly pine for such atrociously overpriced and recycled technology that has existed 10 years prior, and then inhale this copium of &quot;it&#39;s actually pretty good!&quot; when it&#39;s literally impractical to both use and buy.<br><br>Sheep will be sheep I guess! But this time, said sheep will be looking like they&#39;re about to go skiing!"
feels like the chinese government would really love to have this normalized
"I smiled when I heard &quot;It&#39;s a high end&quot;, and thought to myself &quot;Wait two or three years and revisit this video&quot; X )"
High qualit 🤭 ----_-JERRY RIG😁😁
I would be scared of thiefes ripping it from my head outside.
I just don&#39;t like the personas. The facial tracking is very impressive! But the faces themselves are too soft. Like someone took a picture and used a smudging/smoothing tool over their skin. Reminds me of that meme with the really bad CGI face floating in mid-air.
Tried the demo today very impressive! I agree with keyboard usage wish it worked like laptop but super dope
They need to ad physical controllers.
People rely too much on technology if our grid was ever shutdown yall would be incompetent
"why people reserving to say this -- this is a ugly piece of thing, which was never needed and never asked.. AND it will give you eye sore for sure.. <br><br>Apple create any junk, and people start doing &quot;wow, wow&quot;&quot;"
"This is good,I like it."
This is much better then the phone screen being smashed in your face to use it as VR
Wonder why he didn&#39;t put the apple logo when he titled it with reality in the thumbnail. Cause it really isn&#39;t like that in real life! clickbait.
🎉🎉W  wow really appreciate this movie fantastic said
meh
"Thanks for sharing!! I&#39;m curious if you or anyone knows how this product works for people with eyes that have different focal lengths. All the other VR headsets give me immediate nausea, even with diopter adjustments."
Definitely one of the most in-depth an informative reviews I have ever seen on anything whatsoever.  You so very clearly relayed the experience and nature of the Vision Pro.  I had absolutely no idea what this gadget was about since I&#39;ve had very limited exposure to VR but now I get it.  Thank you for the amazing walk-through.
Definitely unsettling 😬😬
👍
Still watching this video
Just like ARI in heavy rain .
Please play Fornite on your Mac Vision Pro
"If I ever get an Apple Vision Pro, the first thing I&#39;m gonna do is watch Ready Player One."
"Ill never buy it, dont want them, but still gonna whatch it"

This will be his most viewed video
"Thank you for the detailed review. It is clear TO ME, that the VR technology is not even at 10% of where it needs to be for me to want to wanna spend 4-5k on it.. I am waiting for that Ready Player 1, VR headset. I wont be settling for less."
&quot;if it&#39;s a URL you can say out loud&quot; 🌚
bruh they copied the ui from the vita
I have a feeling Apple is going to use AI heavily in their next vision pro product. Probably to enhance the faces of the users persona? I&#39;m not sure
Very strong and good video
The future is near!
Immagine this technologie in 10 years with AI and voice control 🤔
"Very interesting video, thanks for breaking it all down.  I&#39;m not an apple guy, in fact I rather loth their walled garden ecosystem but I can appreciate a good piece of tech.  I&#39;m glad they put out such a well polished headset, hopefully it will get a few other manufacturers to step up their game."
This thing is just impressive.... Apple out did themselves
"I think Apple is on the verge of a massive AI build out. What the future holds for these will be interesting to see. Knowing Apple, they will make it lighter and sleeker and probably a Pro and non pro version. I am buying more Apple stock after see this!"
Wonder how long it will take before people start trying to physically take and smash these things if you wear them out of the house... Feels like this might provoke another Google Glass-style insanity.
"I mean it&#39;s cool but 3,500 dollars? Come on Apple"
Well done review!
This product will sell well for the next 1-2 years before it slows down. Then people will start asking themselves what do they really neer it for.
Ironman mode 😅
"As per your other Apple products reviews, this will also be rated the best."
I only recognize you because of Meat Canyon
Is it compatible with Linux?
"Wao! First: this is the first time i have ever watch a review of product and for more than 30min. and Marques you are awsome. Second: this product is Taking us to a very high level in technology, incredible!!!...Cheers from Dominican Republic..."

When &lt;1500 bucks in germany i get it. 2028
"Then in a couple of months, Apple will come with a slimmer version, more powerful and then you&#39;ll hate yourself for buying the first headset @ a whopping $4000! LOL"

it would be cool if you were able to use your PC with the headset.

"And pretty good at ping pong, I see..."
"Yeah, I&#39;m interested but not an Apple fan at all. It&#39;s rumored that Huawei are considering making something similar, I&#39;ll wait for that since it will probably be cheaper and better (Especially since they&#39;re probability analyzing all the current vision pro flaws)"
This is their solution to holograms 🤣 gonna be getting a phone call on your Vision Pro and when you answer you see each others virtual characters 💀
You can turn it off by holding the button and crown down for about 5 seconds.  Then a power off indicator will show up like on an iphone.
"They don&#39;t want to use the term Virtual Reality ... becuase simulator sickness isn&#39;t something they have fixed with current technology. What simulator sickness is, is your brain thinks you are moving and your body is saying you are not moving and thus causing the sickness. This isn&#39;t something that happens to every but it is regular enough to cause issues when training in level D flight simulators for aircraft pilots. It is why they added motion to simulators to help calm it down."
Can i play Rez on it?
"Wait for the 2nd gen to be released, it’s gonna have more features,like receiving phone calls, also Netflix and YouTube apps , the price gonna decrease about a quarter I believe ."

He&#39;s like ill leave the price for last would not want to scare you away that fast. And a none removeable cord so you buy there charger that cost way more then it should lol f apple dude. Making priority connectors and cables sounds about right...

"This is cool tech, but as an everyday thing it isn&#39;t viable.  Wearing a vr headset all day is uncomfortable.  I can watch movies, youtube and do it all on the moon with my normal vr headset.  After the first month it gets old, and I&#39;d rather watch a video on a TV or my phone without having something on my face.  This is the same.  Using it to have multiple monitors?  I can buy some nice monitors for cheaper and not have something on my face?  Hmm which will I choose?  But I can see my messages too!?  Ya, it&#39;s called having a phone.  Cool tech, but it&#39;s a short lived gimmick you pay thousands for and get over in a month"
"It&#39;s just over-hyped. People are carrying a 600 gm box over their head, a thing that limits their vision to 110° only, and they are getting mad doing these stupid things. The real breakthrough will be only when we see people next to us in 3D."
"I think I&#39;ve only seen one video on this that talks about wearing this thing for extended time with the default strap is uncomfortable.  Apple included a regular strap, that goes around and over the head, to take the weight pressing on your face and supporting it with the strap over your head.  No one shows it or mentions it."
Woah.
does it work with glasses? what about eye lense?
Its Amazing!
"I could have 10 million, I’ll still wait for China to make something better and 4x cheaper"
"Knowing Apple, they won&#39;t be able to work out what they&#39;re having trouble with. Sell it and forget it, just like the iPhone (see siri, poor auto correction and many more)"
"It has some interesting aspects about it, but the most impressive would have been a cheaper price. <br>This is just like the first iPhone, iPad etc. it&#39;s a market research device for Apple, you just paid for being a beta tester."
"Can you connect it to a pc to play video games? If not, ite mostly useless for now<br>Most of the development for VR has only been done in gaming<br>The device comes with a lot of new features but its just a glorified iPad<br>Oh wow! You can see their hands! As if you couldn&#39;t on camera<br>It doesn&#39;t actually make much of a difference"
Now does Marques work for Apple at this point? Sure seems like it.
"this tech seems amazing, tho apple is simply pioneering it, i dont think it will kick off unless it becomes more acessible price wise(AKA other companies doing smilar devices(not counting quest at the moment but they are heading to that path))"
Only Apple can convince people to look this stupid.
"reminds me of film &quot;Surrogates&quot; its comming to that ;D for ex others will see you like real hot men or women and you ll see them as furries , that will ruin the wold for sure, not Putin :D"
"Hey!<br><br>i just wanted to share the Gospel that all men need, the Bible says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) this means we all deserve death and separation from a perfect and holy God. But God did not leave us for dead, He sent His only begotten Son to die in yours and my place, so that anyone who believes in Him and repents of sin will be saved from separation from God, and have eternal life! I urge you please put your faith in Jesus Christ and follow Him, He promises to save all who cry out to Him and have a humble heart. We arent guaranteed another day so we must seek Him today while He may be found."

MB: You don&#39;t need to pinch in front of your face.<br>Also MK: pinching in front of his face. 😅
I wonder if it has a lazy eye mode. This is also an opportunity for a mom joke. But I&#39;m kind of curious.
Imagine doing sport by playing FPS games . that will be so crazy !
technically impressive but i still don&#39;t see this being useful. like all VR so far? 🤷‍♂️
I&#39;ll say the same thing I said when the first Ipad came out.  This&#39;ll never catch on...
For some reason the video on the Pass-through looks uncanny and unnatural vs just the external shots of you using the device.
"the world is getting weirder by the minute... like this is designed for people to isolate themselves even more, I mean how are you going to have a normal conversation with another person wearing this?"
"That 3D model thing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1080"">18:00</a> feels like it came straight out of Iron Man and I&#39;m here for it."

"Pretty cool, pity it&#39;s apple."
Here is a crazy idea. Take the money you woukd spend on that and do something in the real world. Smh
Apple: you need to hook a battery to the battery because... we want to force you to use out junk batteries...
"Impressive product, but I&#39;ve seen most of these with Microsoft Hololens over the last 10 years.  And that product hasn&#39;t gone very far in that time.  Apple will be using the telemetry data from people using it to leverage in other tech.   Just like the Hololens, this will become a good, but niche, product mostly used in industrial scenarios."
So you can&#39;t have dix for your eyes? Man...😢
"this is nuts there is nothing in front of you they control your brain ,"
"hear me out hear me out, SpaceTime instead of FaceTime, you share realities or can switch between each others spaces/environments."
This is the sort of tech that will be incredibly laughable in retrospect a few years from now (the way we now laugh at the old brick cellphones).
So it&#39;s like HoloLense from Microsoft?
"As a remote worker, this functionality (especially FaceTime) could be a total gamechanger that makes Apple much more relevant in a corporate environment. Imagine augmenting FaceTime with a presentation mode or virtual conference room. Could reduce the need for international travel. Even one less trip a year pays for this product."
What a dumb idea. Hey are all of you going snorkeling later!
"wow, this design is so dumb. you already got a cable, so how about instead of plugging it into a batterypack, you plug it into an outlet."
AT 9;30 WHAT IS HE EXPLANING IS CONDICONING

How about no. Apple VR? Too late that&#39;s been done already way cheaper. The outer lense is not glass it&#39;s plastic.

"God damn you have such good taste in musical artists. Nitro Fun, Wolfgang Gartner, Melano, Savant, based. Great review, I am not exactly an Apple fan and have a lot of issues with their anti-consumer ecosystem and pricing, but I will give them this: Their M1 and M2 series chips are pretty revolutionary technology in terms of their almost unprecedented level of power relative to space and power consumption, and that kind of ARM based compact and powerful technology is probably gonna be the future in terms ofenabling things like standalone AR/VR headsets that don&#39;t need you to connect them to a high end gaming computer to have a decent experience. My gf got an M1 Pro Macbook and god damn is it a nice laptop. Super powerful, great battery life, nice operating system, way better display than any Windows laptop in that price range."
Persona feels like the animated characters from the polar express...😅
Can&#39;t even imagine how crazy this is going to be by 2030.
i like the fact the is saying &quot;apple vision pro and it turns the video in 114p lol
"This video got more views than Tucker&#39;s interview with P. That&#39;s why we are where we are. No. I did not watch this video. And regarding this device, you are giving away your eyes anatomy and fingerprints to the  government. SHEEP."
God gave me 2 eyes to see his creation and art.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=322"">5:22</a> You can actually turn it off just by holding both buttons for 5 seconds and there will be a power off slider."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=903"">15:03</a> &quot;If it&#39;s a URL you can say out loud&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"So interesting, wish I had 5k to get one lol"
No decent apps nah
I wonder..what do you do if you wear glasses? is it just blurry or does it adjust to your vision (which might be a stretch)? I feel like so many people wear glasses these days but no one talks about it..
But like ft someone whose using an iPhone what do you see and what do they see?
the more you are immersed in your bullshit gadgets the less you are going to see the primitive spears coming at you
this is the goofiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen
i bet its awesome to play pokemon go with that
"you know what, i will not be surprised if they create a headgear/helmet type and then itll be a normal thing people to wear just like eye glasses,"
is this inofficel commercial ? xD
im so glad these are actually terrible and nobody will use them.
"Its nit even glass its glass with a plastic layer on top, cant eait for everyone to have it scratch..."
100% HALF BAKED Product
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1183"">19:43</a> Talking about Maps: Would be cool to being able to jump into Google Street View with Vision Pro. Google Street View would be a mot more emersive 😍"
"I still think the price is overkill, but, for once, I&#39;m actually impressed by Apple."
Can the wearer also wear their own glasses? How does Vision Pro correct eye problems?<br>Can the Vision Pro be used by more than one user?
If you have a blurry vision its a waste of money
his yapping make shits interesting
"Looks incredible, like a next stage of cyberpunk we&#39;ve been living in for a while, but I can&#39;t imagine the case for this device being really more useful and convenient then ordinary interfaces."
i think it needs to be smaller very smaller to be a common thing
"omg, this is a solution in search of a problem that doesn&#39;t exist. So many people will eat this up without even questioning..."
This video was the inspiration for me making a video about the Apple Vision Pro ngl
Yeah lemme get one of those 70$ chevron hoodies! Lmao.. SMH…
whos he looking at lol
Looks like a fun distraction…for an hour or two.
👍
👍
"I dont really get the use for it, seems like overpriced gimmicky software for a VR.  Id way rather use my mouse and keyboard then fingers to pinch stuff and wave my hand around."
:(
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1195"">19:55</a> no fortnite for the vision pro!?!?!"
you know this shit could change the entire generation into a new modernistic era or maybe change history as a whole 💀
I was truly surprised on the lack of streaming video apps like Netflix and others. You would think that would be a key feature for the headset.
One of the best reviews I’ve watched in a very long time. Thank you!
Isn&#39;t that the White Power symbol?.........Z
Now if only it weren&#39;t so cartoony.
There is a new VR headset. Yay!<br>It completely scans your face. Uhhhh...<br>It&#39;s 100% Mac compatible. <br>Hello? Anyone there?
Do You want Burger.
In cons you forgot to say addiction
It’s a fake one
TL;DR: Buy a Quest 3
I feel like anyone with over a million subscribers should only ever show up as a persona in any media. This goes for influencers and dulm actors who&#39;ve grossed over a million dollars.
pretty good video; not excited about the product
"One thing though that needs to happen for me to be actually even remotely interested is you need to be able to rotate, tilt, and fully scale and distort anchored panes/planes/panels.<br>If I can&#39;t pay down and tiltz or place it on my ceiling, who cares?<br>It&#39;s one major complaint I have about all of Meta&#39;s UI."
Where is the value?
Apple is fascinating company! I know there was silly tryes to make virtual reality hardware at early 2000s! All those blocky huge silly devices. And no wonder Apple is brougt it all back in professional manner!
"Yeah, that&#39;s what I want to do with a VR headset... look at my calendar. This has got to be the coolest high quality tech in an exciting VR genre...doing the most mundane tasks."
"There&#39;s a lot to like and there&#39;s a lot to hate. The number one thing I like about it is that there&#39;s going to be a lot of creative professionals with really expensive software, multitasking with these things and providing feedback to software developers which is going to lead to some efficient leaps and bounds that we haven&#39;t been able to see in the more gaming centric headsets preceding Apple&#39;s contribution to the field.<br>The outward-facing OLED in my opinion is kind of wasteful but who am I to say what rich people should do with their money and I suppose there&#39;s some gotta be some kind of reasonable use outside of cosmetic use... ?<br>But yeah, it wastes money, and what is already a miniscule battery.<br>I hate the proprietary plug that&#39;s really stupid for consumers, the external battery pack leaving the headset completely front focused shows that they&#39;ve got a long way to go and they&#39;re rather tone deaf regarding actual long-term use of a VR headset. The lack of 3D virtualized environmental offerings beyond what is likely to be an excellent pass through and otherwise augmented reality experience is off-putting, but it&#39;s good to see that despite the closed ecosystem there are people out there making these things work and additionally I figure eventually it will be a priority to actually provide interesting software and services supporting their platform. I do think there&#39;s a certain element of anti-competitive practices that are keeping a lot of software from being supported on the Apple platform but I&#39;m not surprised by that as they&#39;re late to the game and capitalizing like they normally do.<br>in the end additionally the exorbitant cost of this thing isn&#39;t really something that should be surprising considering this is definitely an early adopter thing and as such while it has a lot of good features these are basically the stock standard features that everyone expects in virtual at this time but again with a price point that is 3 - 8 times more than it&#39;s nearest competitors depending on where you place this in the market. The trick to that is is it&#39;s not really in an external market and that&#39;s the strength that it brings to the external market oddly enough. The fact is the strongest thing about this headset is that it&#39;s going to bring people from within the apple microculture and introduce them to something they&#39;ve stayed mostly ignorant about and and it&#39;s going to bring a lot of enthusiasm and innovation into the future of entertainment and what is essentially the evolution of the cell phone and micro computer.<br>I only wish they had gone with a transparent setup with a an electronic array of localized dimmers or glass that can be made opaque in zones so the passthrough and display elements could work in tandem and allowing an overlay on things you can actually see through the displays rather than relying only on cameras and lidar for producing passthrough. That it&#39;s not a full XR experience is a bummer, but the more these megacorp entities invest in the tech, and the more they saddle the losses for the sake of the longevity of the innovations, the better it will be for us, so I&#39;m all for it, at least in the context of advancing the technology.<br>So, were not really even close to Being there with this headset, but at least it&#39;s opening more eyes to the reality of virtual reality, and how beneficial it can be for many."
As someone that travels quite a bit with a laptop and 3 portable monitors. If they could get 2-3 virtual displays then I would buy this just for that.
Can I wear these and put my tesla on auto drive?
RIP ppl with lazy eye.
Same
Why not the helmet?<br>Instead
Isn’t it more augmented rather than virtual reality
Apple likes to gatekeep apps... The question everyone wants to know: do they allow vr🌽?
24 milliion in less than 15 days
I could not be seen in public wearing this thing.
Need  Xiaomi version
"Where is google glass? It was much innovative than this in my opinion.,.."
"Looks to me lke impressive new technology that has yet to be seen what its potential is, honestly for me all these features feel more novelty than actually useful, then again, im not a mac user, i own nothing of mac, number of reasons, big one tho is how much an effort mac makes to eliminate all an any cross compatibilities"
Marques is the best reviewer out there today.
Connect on MAC.<br>no i choose Windows 😂😂😂😂
Nerd Googles
"So if somehow someone steal your persona, can freerly pretend to be you? . Mmm dunno. Too much invasive technology"
The thing is that developers purchase two three big size screens for thier work and with this device they can have unlimited screens. <br><br>Crazy stuff<br><br>First time I am impressed with apple for thier genuine justified price product.<br><br>Its next level thing. The only concern is the weight of this device. <br><br>As it is first gen may be this device will come down to a mere size normal sunglasses than it would b definitely much cooler and futuristic than ever.<br><br><br>And it will definitely open markets for big innovators like samsung to compete with apple. And will se the bulky thing getting pinched to a normal eyewear size.<br><br><br>6-7 years This will be a big thing.....
whats with the top hat? who is your stylist?
this is the most dystopian shit... and im about to live through that mofo
If the battery pack was connected through a port people would just use better and cheaper batteries for it.
"Looks clunky, reminds me of the early days Apple computer"
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1960"">32:40</a> you three look like Mac deities or something people in a tropical country would pray to."
"This seems like it could actually be an awesome pdoduct, if not for the orwellian mass data and biometrics harvesting aspect."
"Samsung Galaxy S24U (I assume) at the end of this video, did make me trusting this guy. :D 👍"
"Why on earth would you want to recreate reality when you can just add to it? VR headset will always be a failure, they will only succeed when Hologram technology is perfected. processing power of reality won’t be necessary as you can just see straight through. All processing power and hardware design can be put towards Hologram operations. <br>MS HOLOLENSE 2+ is on the right path, however tech limitations and advancement is the problem. <br> <br>So instead of making these VR headsets, companies should invest this ridiculous money spent making these VR&#39;s towards Hologram Research and Development.<br><br>And maybe the Military can be nice enough to leak some of thier tech? ;)"
oh wow let me put on huge awkward goggles on my face instead of pulling out my 6 inch phone
Fantastic breakdown
"its funny how they never improoved  electricity, wirelessly. batterys.. etc. seems like they dont want to upgrade tech wich made them billions. hmm.."
What if A.I.are trying to learn how to be a human?
good bye biometric data and unique retina scans. hello social control china!
TOO MUCH LITE in eyes = BLINDNESS so this one guy wore 50 hrs not taking VR off not good.

I would tape redmi 12 to my face
How am i just finding out about this 😂
This can&#39;t be good for your eyes.
The movie (the portable door) in real life 😂
it would probably be cool for a day or two... not worth $4k
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=321"">5:21</a> I watched a video that showed 2 ways to turn it off. 1) go to settings then general and select Turn Off at the very bottom or 2) press and hold both the digital crown and the camera button until you see the turn off slider in front of you."
"So, lets talk about health with this device...how much EMF radiation does it give off? having a computer right on your head, next to your brain , eyes .... yikes....but other than that ...it looks like a very cool device 😁"
"Fill in the blank: &quot;Eyes are the windows to the ____&quot;. Don&#39;t believe it? That&#39;s too bad, because Apple does. It&#39;s right in their logo."
People without VR being jealous of people with😂😂😂😂
Can I hook up my Xbox controller and play my steam games like Skyrim VR?
Bro...WTF do you have on your head?Is that.....HAIR?😂😂😂😂😂😂
the future of gaming might be coming soon
"New episode of black mirror or something, idk"
"This is so incredibly well done and produced.  Content creator in a whole other league.  Keep doing what you&#39;re doing, much respect."
"Difficult for Lightroom <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1406"">23:26</a>"
So you could actually do gaming from the macbook pro? It surprised me that Marques didnt try it
the modern world is a fucking nightmare already wooohoooo!
"The future is now, old man!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=708"">11:48</a> all fun until it starts showing ads"
From this to Quest.....nothing&#39;s that impressive. <br>And this thing is definitely not 2/3+ thousand more impressive.......absolutely not.
Brain tumor loves this product
From the start of the video. I thought you were wearing an Omni Man logo shirt 😅
Y’all realise this is perfect for the government they will be spying thru the headsets the same way they do your phone camera 😂
"I have a battery pack of that size which is 30,000mah!"
Did us dirty with the ps vita home screen
I would never afford such a thing :(
the Batary Caple is removable
they managed to make another SAO headset
"@Marques I thought you did an experiment with the Google watch, why are you still putting on the Apple watch?"
"It makes me want to buy it, but from owning a Vive, I know the lack of selection in apps is really going to hurt. So I&#39;m going to wait for the maybe Third or fourth iteration if it gets there"
I can&#39;t even wear over the ear headphones. I could wear this monstrous head gear for five minutes at best. Do not want.
– Anyone here know where I can find that wallpaper on the Mac back there to the left?
its AR not VR
Anybody want to buy a kidney
this is amazing
31:3personas
why?
"a useless expensive toy, Apple have already failed... and Google Glass, remember)))?"
Epic Games is developing Ready Player One
Vision pro🤡🏳️‍🌈😂
Does it work with prescription glasses?
"Very good review. I&#39;m impressed with the product and Marques. He did a rather thorough test, which I think all of us appreciate."
Augmented reality headset?
it has a removable cable... You can remove it using a sim ejector tool
I bet adult videos feel ... super emersive
Pointless especially for the price.
"A thumb-up rule for Apple new things is go for the second gen. That’s why I had iPod mini 2, iPod nano 2, iPad 2, iPhone 3G, with the only exception being MacBook Pro 16 2021 which was the first gen of this size, apple silicon and mini-led, as for which I’d say I could have been better to know something earlier."
"Amazing review, will help me make an informed decision on this device in the future!"

He said “as long as it’s a URL u can say outloud!” 😂 Siri open the HUB
I want to know what would happen if it caught a virus 😂
Why not add a <b>*tap by elevating your upper eyelid (staring)*</b> feature ? Maybe wouldn&#39;t be comfortable to use for long times but it would very practical while using hands for something else<br>And glide typing would be very nice too with the pinched fingers of course
"Apple has a remarkable obsession for metal, which forced me to sell my AirPod Max at half the price I got it. I may still think that is a premium headset, however I wasn’t able to get along with things that gave me real physical headache whenever I used it for more than an hour."

It&#39;s fun and interesting to watch, and your diction is very good so I didn&#39;t need to turn on subtitles, which I usually do when I&#39;m not wearing my hearing aid device. Regarding product, no way I am paying this price. Once V2 comes out with less weight, better battery life and better battery solution overall, as well as with more acceptable price, I might consider it. In the meantime, I&#39;ve subbed to your channel and looking forward for more reviews done by you. Thanks bro!"
Shit reminds me of black mirror
who the F would like to walk around looking like that...  i will laugh high and point if i see tragic people walk around like that... ha ha ha ha ha ha
nuh-uh
Dont do it. Dont let put a veil on your eyes. Feels like the eye glass tech from Incredibles 2

It’s not impressive.. he’s trying so hard 😂😂
I&#39;m only interested in this for the possibility of using it for 3d modelling and painting... that&#39;d be cool. Integration with Procreate etc.
I have seen videos of people turning the Vision Pro off by pushing the digital crown and the other button in simujltaniously for a few seconds kind of like an IPhone so it IS possible to turn it off
I don&#39;t have but still I know how to use 😅😂
Apple vision pro is racist

"With Apple releasing this, the question that will come more and more in our heads will be &quot;Is it live, or is it Memorex?&quot;"
I think they will have it dialed in maybe 3-5 years when it can replace the desktop.
anyway you explain and discuss very well. WELL DONE Better than any talk show host or tv presenter well done
I could see someone hacking into these sets and set up a fake action in the headset that freaks or makes you react accordingly and you do something dumb
it should be pointy finger swipeing and a forward motion of pushing a button. Pinching is already giving me RSI awkwardness. Virtual reality is at the baby phase for sure. Hopefully a better company makes a real VR headset not this hype
One step closer to being Agent Nahman Jayden. Just want to toss a virtual ball against a wall.
"A nice piece of junk for the gullible to buy <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcIfY57lBJXp6AKBx4CoCA""></a>"
i gotta be honest. the apple vision pro seems very gimicky to me. i think this sort of stuff is in its infancy and its not worth 3 4k. 1k max. at the moment it seems like a ipad is still the best choice
"Just apple cementing their domination of technology, its awesome"
Does it have night vision?
AUGMENTED REALITY?
very very well explained. great job dude!
Does it make you dizzy after an hour or so. <br>Does it get blurry or make your eyes tear up?
Go look other augmented reality glasses
I don’t liek it got a bad feeling
"People do anything now, wear a phone on their face"

Isn&#39;t the Apple vision pro technically a AR headset
What about headphones??? Can you use headphones with these??? Air pods????
It’s really a great product from Apple
does the glass screen always shake along with the head or is it fixed at where it was? <br>i felt kinda fainted when watching ur video when your head was moving.
This was one of the best reviews I’ve ever seen. I want this thing so bad now after watching this video. So many cool features

"So we are getting closer to iron man&#39;s vision and in future updates it might be possible to know about things, like in Google lens but in vision pro in real time"
Apple is very good with software development lol this is crazy
I need it
Fantastic review
"I like how you say it is high quality, yet it is just as basic quality as the Meta Quest 3.  The &quot;glass&quot; that is on the front is actually level 3 scratchable plastic that is called &quot;glass&quot;.  And USB-C literally clicks in place, so it doesn&#39;t come off easily.  Apple proprietary power is just Apple telling you that you have to pay a lot for their product."
👍
He said quit recording bc he had something for Unk .😌 gun💨
What a time to be alive . The future is gonna be interesting for VR AR
"Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the first version of this device, so the next versions will develop like the smartphones, if people will use this to replace their other devices. Either way, I prefer a solid boundary between a device and the real world, so I will stay loyal to my smartphone and the traditional devices."
So its basiclly usless. Make u look weird without any additional benefits from what u get from your smartphone.
freaks meowt
So if you re not into Apple ecosystem already the headset is pretty much useless aftes the initial wow factor...Sweet
Well that’s sad that you can’t really do anything actually fascinating with them
"Bro, you’re easy to listen to. <br>Great delivery."
"A great example of things we don&#39;t need, and should go without, in a world where human civilization is in a state of pronounced ecological overshoot and on the verge of runaway global heating."
650 grams is as heavy as a sword I own.
Why do I need that???
You left out a huge proponent... gaming immersion.
I would wear them for a couple hours and then put them in a drawer and probably never use them again
im sure down the track they will impliment new features that are entirly unheard of today anddifferent uses that the vision can be used for
Will not buy that and wait a bit longer for neurolink
You can turn it off without disconnecting the cord.
"Good review.. However, I&#39;m not gonna spend a penny on an Apple thing"
Ready Player One.
Who cares about VR it&#39;s old technology when these dip sticks going to bring out hologram technology you know they got it.
Bloody ridiculous
With this i can watch por- i mean cartoon
"Looks great for coding on multiple screens without having real big screen work setups. That to me as a developer is the biggest advantage.  Also this is just the first iteration of the vision pro. It will only get better over time.  Trouble is I spent $4k on my Mac book pro this year (that should last me a good 15 years for coding, video editing, training some basic ML models etc).  Need to wait till my funds pile up before getting the vision pro."
Just what we need. Something additional to disrupt normal human interaction.
Zuckerberg is correct.  The metaverse is the future.  In 2034  everyone is going to be using these things.
chaturbate is gonna be soooooo much funner
No thanks.
Me earning 35 dollar per month and still watching😢
10days 25milion views
Hmm
"I don&#39;t understand, who is in his straight mind that would use VR for computing! <br>VR&#39;s only use is for games, other than that it&#39;s so ridiculous to consider, and I don&#39;t think gamers are on apple systems neither can it carry advanced GPU for the task. Another ridiculous item by apple that will sell to idiot-riches due to marketing such was the apple watch."
Waste of money
Can we see what the persona looks like when the lights are off in the room around you or dim
Should be titanium .. i bought it yesterday its a bit heavy
Great Job!  Very well organized and comprehensive feature overview of the Vision Pro.  <br>As an original Lisa owner... this is a quantum leap computing technology!<br>I&#39;d love to see where it goes....!
An Elvis type sunglass size would be cooler looking in 2 years time.
That’s just another expensive Apple product…
"matrix inside the matrix, good luck humanity"
How much additional $monetization$ data is Apple collecting with this device?  ANSWER: INFINITE INSURANCE POLICY

so it outputs HDR all the time thats cool.<br>but i dont get it with that ping pong stuff.<br>did you play solo with no other person or is that other opponent real?
Apples goal is to dehumanize society
We in a black mirror episode fr
"There would be a tiny tiny chance that I could get that only if it worked perfectly with android and windows. But even then, I mist likely will never ever get that trash!"
So if it&#39;s going off by your hands and everything that you mentioned what about people that have lost arms hands fingers is it not accessible for them
The design of thing doesn’t look like an apple product at all.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=2131"">35:31</a> FedEx sponsorship in the background 😂"
I wonder which website were you thinking of when he said &quot;if you can say the URL out loud&quot;  😂
"Of course companies backed out lol I know Apple is used to selling higher end expensive products... But take away the subsidies for iPhone, and your sales would tank. A super pricy VR headset will not dominate the market like they want it to. Idk what they&#39;re thinking."
Dystopia has finally arrived. (Turns out Blade Runner was a preview of the future.) Imagine the military version.
Technology is making people a lot worse. Unfortunately lots of people are too addicted and have become lazy rather than experiencing life.
"Has FedEx paid you for an advertising at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=2133"">35:33</a>?"
"its actually an AR headset, not VR"
99% will watch porn with it... i am one of those
I&#39;m really glad that apple put this out so that all the current apps that are on my $300 Meta Quest 2 headset will go out of their way to copy the various convenience features to give me all the same benefits without having to own any apple products.
Lawnmower man
i was messing around with it and i figured out that you can turn it off by holding the two top buttons and then turn it of inside like an iphone
Great review thank you
Just wait our grandkids will laugh at how big this is and how it’s not implanted into our eyes at birth
"I&#39;m excited by the ability to seamlessly integrate with Mac, but most importantly, this was an exceptionally comprehensive review that covered every aspect necessary in deciding whether to purchase or not. Your clear attention to detail and thorough, even-handed analysis have provided tremendous value for your viewers. Kudos to you for crafting such an insightful video that will help Apple fans determine if this product aligns with their needs and expectations. Well done!"
The Apple Vision Pro got better face capture than 2k24 lmaooo
Apple wasted so much dough on this. Now the iphones are going to cost 2K in 2025 to make up for the financial loss from this dumb oculus rip off .
Quest 3 but more expensive
"I feel like throwing up just watching five minutes of demo. The whole wide angle effect  reminds me of the old Douglas Trumbull movie “brainstorm“ which swapped between an enhanced high def image to simulate a “replay” of brain recordings - that was also is vaguely nauseating. My entire problem with the device is I don’t wanna have to be fully focused on my computer all the time I want to be half watching Netflix, half listening to Spotify and half gazing out the window bored while I sit at my computer at work!"
How come the fingers in front of the viewer look glitchy?
Why not use gesture?? For txt input
anybody else noticing the clear lighter skin patch around his eyes? I think hes been wearing it a lot lol
